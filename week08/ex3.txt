Swap-out is a technique for moving a process from RAM to the hard disc.
Swap-in is a method of transferring a program from a hard disc to main memory, or RAM
We can see in the exercise that if the value is 10 MB si and so are not changing much
when increasing to 1000 MB si and so change their values
and the SWPD starts to increase because there will be more data in the hard disk
